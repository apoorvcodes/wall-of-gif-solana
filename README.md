# Wall of gif with Solana

A web application that allows you to create and share wall of gifs! Built on top of solana blockchain.

## Installation and Usage

### Getting the frontend up and running

Install the dependencies first for the project.

```sh
yarn
# OR
npm install
```

Now, go to the solana app, and install its dependencies in the same way.

```sh
cd solana_app

yarn
# OR
npm install
```

Once you're done, Ensure that you have the solana toolchain ready. If you don't, there are instructions on how-to do that
in the section below.

Now, you need to deploy your solana program. You can find the instructions in the section in the end of installation and
usage, on how you can do it.

Once you have deployed, copy the IDL file from `target/idl/solana_app.json` in `solana_app` to `src/assets` in react project
into a file called `idl.json`.

Done? Awesome! Now, generate the keypair for handling accounts.

```sh
cd src
node createKeyPair.js
cd ..
```

Now, Open up your phantom wallet (Install it, if you don't have it!), and switch the network to devnet. Then, fund the account
by copying the public key, and using this command,

```sh
solana airdrop 5 <wallet-public-key>  --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Great job! You're good to go. Now, you can run `npm run start` to start up the app, or host it anywhere you want ‚ú®

### Solana and toolchain installation

To get started with solana, you need to have rust installed on your local system.

To quickly install solana, Follow this [guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#use-solanas-install-tool).

Ensure that it's installed by running,

```sh
solana --version
```

If it works without errors, That means it's good to go.

Now it's time to install Anchor. You can install it easily by following the official documentation,
[here](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-rust).

To test if it works fine too, use this command.

```sh
anchor --version
```

Now, Generate a Keypair using the solana CLI suite and check the address.

```sh
solana-keygen new
solana address
```

### Deploying your Solana program to devnet

To start deploying, first switch your net to devnet.

```sh
solana config set --url devnet
```

Finally, airdrop yourself some SOL on the devnet.

```sh
solana airdrop 2
solana balance
```

Now, It's time to configure the variables.

In `Anchor.toml`, change `[programs.localnet]` to `[programs.devnet]`.

Then, change `cluster = "localnet"` to `cluster = "devnet"`.

Run the build through anchor using,

```sh
anchor build
```

This creates a program ID for us. Access it using,

```sh
solana address -k target/deploy/solana_app-keypair.json
```

Copy the ID and change it in the `declare_id!()` section in the `lib.rs` located inside `programs/solana_app/src`. Now,
go to `Anchor.toml`, and replace the ID with the same one you copied above under `[programs.devnet]`.

By default the location for the keypair for Anchor to load is set to `~/.config/solana/id.json`. If you are using a custom
path, make sure to update the `Anchor.toml` to use your custom path.

Good to go? Now run `anchor build`!

Awesome. Now, just deploy it using the final command - `anchor deploy`. Boom, You're all set.

You can track your program using the [Solana explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet), and by searching for your
program using the ID you obtained from the JSON file.
